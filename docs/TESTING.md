## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Playwright Installation Fails**:
```bash
npx playwright install --force
```

**Tests Fail in CI**:

- Verify baseURL configuration
- Review network timeouts

**Performance Tests Unstable**:
- Run multiple times for average
- Check system resources
- Consider longer timeouts

**Accessibility Tests Fail**:
- Review axe-core violations
- Check color contrast
- Validate keyboard navigation
